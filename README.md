1.Write a program that will compute the product of two positive integers (firstno and secondno) by adding them repeatedly. 
  This means adding firstno to itself secondno times.

2.Modify exercise number 1 and allow positive and negative numbers as inputs to be multiplied.  
  Hint:  Take absolute values first then use condition statements.

3.Write a program that will compute the quotient (including the remainder) of two positive integers (firstno divided by secondno) 
  by subtracting them repeatedly.  This means subtracting firstno to secondno repeatedly until the difference is less than secondno.

4.Write a program that will add all prime number by letting the user specify the range of number to process.

5.Write a program that gets the Fibonacci of a number read from the user.  The Fibonacci number sequence begins with 1, 
  1 then each succeeding number in the sequence is the sum of the previous ones.  
  For example, an input of 5 will produce 1, 1, 2, 3, 5 and an input of 8 will produce 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21 and  
  an input of 2 will produce 1, 1.

6.Write a program that will compute for the factorial of a supplied number.  
  The factorial of the number if the product of those numbers starting from 1 to the supplied number.

7.An integer is perfect if it is the sum of its proper divisors.  For example 
  6   = 1 + 2 + 3 
  28 = 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14.

  Write a program that determines whether or not an integer input from a terminal is perfect.

8.Write a program that will derive the sum of series of a number.  For example, an input of 5 will produce (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15).
